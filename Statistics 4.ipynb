For example, the 25th percentile of the distribution can be found by solving the equation F(x) = 0.25, which gives x=3.29.

    "It is important to note that if these assumptions are not met, the CLT may not hold, and other methods may be necessary for statistical inference. Additionally, while the CLT provides a useful approximation for many real-world situations, it is not always exact and may not hold in certain cases. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution and use other statistical methods to confirm the results obtained from the CLT."
